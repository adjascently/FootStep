# FootStep: Microsoft Future Ready Talent Project

## Features:
Problem Statement: In our website, I have created a shoe store website that helps to find good quality shoes to help people to buy their favorite shoes from a variety of options. It is a customizable website which can be used by shoe stores to display their products.

Project Description: I created a website named 'FootStep' using HTML and CSS.This website will help people to buy some of the best shoes for both female and male users. There are different pages like the home page, men, women, about and contact page. One can also see the check out page which has some items added to the cart. This website can be used by shoe companies to showcase their products and can be used as their own customised website.
